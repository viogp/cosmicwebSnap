## Models ##

* Understand the differences between gp15newmg and gp17

* Understand the differences between gp17.spin and gp17

* What if I use a model that reproduces the passive fraction at z=0 by changing the Font model.

## Cosmic Web ##
* Complete the information on how to copy to taurus and where to run things (make a test!)


## Analysis ##

* Find out about possibilities to compare the classifications. Maybe focus only on those galaxies that do not overlap? Moustaka's bayesian something for weighting probabilites?

* Could I compare directly w r0? Maybe using the lightcone?

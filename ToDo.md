## Models ##

* What plots can help understanding the differences between gp15newmg and gp17? and gp17.spin/gp17?

* Finish the plots for gp17.spin

* Do I need new runs for snapshot 39?

* What if I use a model that reproduces the passive fraction at z=0 by changing the Font model.

## Cosmic Web ##

* Make a test with the file I copied to taurus.


## Analysis ##

* Find out about possibilities to compare the classifications. Maybe focus only on those galaxies that do not overlap? Moustaka's bayesian something for weighting probabilites?

* Could I compare directly w r0? Maybe using the lightcone?

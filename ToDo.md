## ELGs ##

* VVDS-Wide: I used r-band, instead of i. Shall I create an Erratum or simply comment? The only issue with the later: I don't think I'll be using VVDS. According to the MNRAS website, Erratums are advise if there is a change to the conclusions.

* Make stellar mass and SFR function plots with the number density of the ELGs on top and select the comparison samples.

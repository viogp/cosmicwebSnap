## Models ##

* griffinBH or griffinBH.stb075

* prepare DB: check bands and properties output, make a mini test, create ref file, write Peder for him to launch if he can.

## Cosmic Web ##

* Make a test with the file I copied to taurus.


## ELGs ##

* VVDS-Wide: I used r-band, instead of i. Shall I create an Erratum or simply comment? The only issue with the later: I don't think I'll be using VVDS.

* Make a LF plot at sn=29 for DEEP2, VVDS-WIDE, eBOSS, DESI (add Hizels data?). 

* Make stellar mass and SFR function plots with the number density of the ELGs on top and select the comparison samples.


## Comparing populations ##

* Find out about possibilities to compare the classifications. Maybe focus only on those galaxies that do not overlap? Moustaka's bayesian something for weighting probabilites?

* Could I compare directly w r0? Maybe using the lightcone?

## Models ##

* What plots can help understanding the differences between gp15newmg and gp17? and gp17.spin/gp17?

* Finish the plots for gp17.spin

* What if I use a model that reproduces the passive fraction at z=0 by changing the Font model.

## Cosmic Web ##

* Make a test with the file I copied to taurus.


## ELGs ##

* Can I use VVDS-Wide? it seemed like it had changed a lot! Is this due to using different fibers?

* Update the eBOSS definition? -> need to check e-mails and papers

* Make a LF plot at sn=29 for DEEP2, VVDS-WIDE, eBOSS, DESI (add Hizels data?). 

* Make stellar mass and SFR function plots with the number density of the ELGs on top and select the comparison samples.


## Comparing populations ##

* Find out about possibilities to compare the classifications. Maybe focus only on those galaxies that do not overlap? Moustaka's bayesian something for weighting probabilites?

* Could I compare directly w r0? Maybe using the lightcone?

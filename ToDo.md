## Models ##

* prepare DB: make a mini test, wait for Peder to reply

* Text on model

* Redo all ELG's paper plots with gp18.BH

## Cosmic Web ##

* Make a test with the file I copied to taurus.


## ELGs ##

* VVDS-Wide: I used r-band, instead of i. Shall I create an Erratum or simply comment? The only issue with the later: I don't think I'll be using VVDS. According to the MNRAS website, Erratums are advise if there is a change to the conclusions.

* Make a LF plot at sn=39,41 for DEEP2, VVDS-WIDE, eBOSS, DESI (add Hizels data?). 

* Make stellar mass and SFR function plots with the number density of the ELGs on top and select the comparison samples.

## Comparing populations ##

* Find out about possibilities to compare the classifications. Maybe focus only on those galaxies that do not overlap? Moustaka's bayesian something for weighting probabilites?

* Could I compare directly w r0? Maybe using the lightcone?

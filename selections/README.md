0**mass_cum.py, sfr_cum.py** Cumulative abundance of all galaxies and ELGs vs stellar mass, SFR.

**elg_mselections.py, elg_sselections.py** Create input for the environment code for cuts in stellar mass and SFR for the ELGs.

**find_mass_cuts.py, find_sfr_cuts.py** Find the stellar mass, SFR cut that gives the required cut in number density for the whole sample, given the same number densities as for the ELGS.

**mass_selections.py, sfr_selections.py**  Create input for the environment code for all galaxies selected by number density cuts.

**gsmf_files.py** Generate files with the GSMF (unrelated to the environment study).
